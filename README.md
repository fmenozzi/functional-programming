# Functional Programming Self-Study
A repository for functional programming self-study. Will be following [this book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters). Progress for each chapter can be found in the respective directory within this repository.

In addition to following the book, my goal is to reproduce several key coherent noise functions (value, Perlin, Worley, etc.) in Haskell, with the ultimate end goal of producing a single Haskell program capable of creating 2D renderings of each noise function as a .pgm image.
